## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Flex
- CSS Grid
- Hosting - Firebase

### What I learned

I learnt about CSS Media Queries and how to use them effectively and how to make websites responsive to different screen size. Even though I used media queries i still am new to this area and need more practice to get better at it. Additionally, I delved into CSS Flexbox, a layout model that provides me with a more efficient way to distribute space and align content within a container.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
	.container {
		background-color: var(--clr-card-100);
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: column;

		padding: 1.5rem;
		width: 325px;
		height: 530px;
		border-radius: 1.5rem;

		box-shadow: 10px 10px 0px black;
	}
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to learn more about semantics and make my code more readable and maintainable. I also want to learn more about CSS Grid and how to use it effectively. I want to learn more about responsive design and how to make my websites responsive. I also want to learn more about JavaScript and how to use it in my projects. I also want to learn how to use CSS properties and values effectively.
